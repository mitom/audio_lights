# Audio lights

A small python program I picked up and added some amateur colour calculation. A simple web interface is attached to adjust the settings for the colour generation.
My plan with it is to run it on a Raspberry Pi with a microphone and use it to provide mood lightning to music or possibly even conversation.
Hopefully I'll manage to make it clap activated (the cheesy 2 clap to activate/deactivate)

Run it with `app.py -p` to display the chart.
